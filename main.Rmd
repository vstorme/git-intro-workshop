This is just a tiny document to illustrate Git with RStudio. The complete illustration contains:

  + main.Rmd: the main rmarkdown-file
  + child1.Rmd: the first child to include in the main-file
  + child2.Rmd: the second child to include in the main-file
  + functiesTestGit.R: an R-file containing some functions that are used
  

In the first chunk: just load some libraries, set some options and source the R-file for acces to the functions.
  
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(pander)

source("functiesTestGit.R")



knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=14, fig.height=8,
                      echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)


```


In the first child-file, some data from the dataset 'iris' are plotted.

```{r child="child1.Rmd"}


```


The second child-file, provides a summary table of the same dataset.

```{r child="child2.Rmd"}

```
